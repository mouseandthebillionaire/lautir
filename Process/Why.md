# Design Goals

## 02.19.26

The initial idea for this project came from Han's [Scent of Time]() and the ways that an enstrangement of time can lead to contemplative ends. The main question: what does restricting the time available (say a 5 minute window at exactly noon each day) do for the play experience? This design goal of _limited-window access_ will be paired with _minimalistic visuals_ and _procedural adaptive sound_.
